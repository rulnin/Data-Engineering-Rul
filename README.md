# 👋 Hi, I'm Arul – Aspiring Data Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate data professional with a strong interest in **data engineering**, **data pipelines**, and **automated data workflows**. With a background in Information Systems and hands-on experience in system implementation and data systems within the industry, I'm building robust data solutions that turn raw data into meaningful insights.

## 🚀 My Interest in Data Engineering

Data has always fascinated me – especially how it flows, transforms, and scales. I'm deeply interested in designing **end-to-end data pipelines**, working with tools like **Airflow**, **Apache Spark**, and **SQL**, and ensuring data is **clean, reliable, and delivered on time** for analytics.

What excites me most is solving real-world problems by:
- Integrating disparate data sources
- Automating ETL/ELT workflows
- Creating scalable and maintainable data infrastructure

I’m continuously learning and currently exploring cloud-based data tools (GCP, AWS), dbt for data modeling, and orchestration frameworks.
