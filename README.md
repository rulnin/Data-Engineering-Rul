# 👋 Hi, I'm Arul – Aspiring Data Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate data professional with a strong interest in **data engineering**, **data pipelines**, and **automated data workflows**. With a background in Information Systems and hands-on experience in system implementation and data systems within the industry, I'm building robust data solutions that turn raw data into meaningful insights.

## 🚀 My Interest in Data Engineering

Data has always fascinated me – especially how it flows, transforms, and scales. I'm deeply interested in designing **end-to-end data pipelines**, working with tools like **Airflow**, **Apache Spark**, and **SQL**, and ensuring data is **clean, reliable, and delivered on time** for analytics.

What excites me most is solving real-world problems by:
- Integrating disparate data sources
- Automating ETL/ELT workflows
- Creating scalable and maintainable data infrastructure

I’m continuously learning and currently exploring cloud-based data tools (GCP, AWS), dbt for data modeling, and orchestration frameworks.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies I Use

Here are the data engineering tools I’ve mastered, along with their core functions:

### 🧑‍💻 Programming & Data Processing
- **Python**: Core scripting for ETL, APIs, data cleaning, and automation
- **R**: Data analysis, statistical computing, and dashboarding
- **Pandas**: Data wrangling and transformation for structured data

### 🗃️ Data Orchestration & ETL
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration and task scheduling
- **Talend Open Studio**: Visual ETL development for integrating various data sources
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: Data transformation and modeling in SQL-based workflows

### 🛢️ Databases & Query Languages
- **SQL and NoSQL**: Data querying and manipulation
- **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL Server, DBeaver**: RDBMS systems for structured data storage and querying
- **Snowflake, Google BigQuery**: Scalable cloud data warehouses for analytical workloads

### 📊 Data Visualization & BI Tools
- **Metabase**: Open-source BI dashboarding
- **Plotly Dash, Shiny, Streamlit**: Python and R-based dashboard apps for data storytelling
- **Looker Studio, Tableau, Microsoft Report Builder**: Interactive dashboards and data reporting for business insights

### ⚙️ DevOps & Collaboration
- **Docker**: Containerization for reproducible and scalable environments
- **Git / GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development
- **Slack**: Team communication and collaboration in data projects

### 🔥 Big Data
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing for large-scale analytics
