# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name] – Aspiring Data Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate data professional with a strong interest in **data engineering**, **data pipelines**, and **automated data workflows**. With a background in Information Systems and hands-on experience in system implementation and data systems within the manufacturing industry, I'm building robust data solutions that turn raw data into meaningful insights.

## 🚀 My Interest in Data Engineering

Data has always fascinated me – especially how it flows, transforms, and scales. I'm deeply interested in designing **end-to-end data pipelines**, working with tools like **Airflow**, **Apache Spark**, and **SQL**, and ensuring data is **clean, reliable, and delivered on time** for analytics.

What excites me most is solving real-world problems by:
- Integrating disparate data sources
- Automating ETL/ELT workflows
- Creating scalable and maintainable data infrastructure

I’m continuously learning and currently exploring cloud-based data tools (GCP, AWS), dbt for data modeling, and orchestration frameworks.

## 🧰 My Data Engineering Portfolio

Here are some of the projects I've built that demonstrate my technical skills and interest in data engineering:

### 📊 [Manufacturing Data Pipeline Project](https://github.com/yourusername/manufacturing-data-pipeline)
> *Tools: Airflow, Python, PostgreSQL, DBT, Metabase, Docker*

- Scraped public manufacturing production data from [TradingEconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/car-production)
- Built an **automated ETL pipeline** using Apache Airflow
- Modeled data with **dbt**, stored it in **PostgreSQL**, and visualized KPIs with **Metabase**
- Dockerized the entire workflow for easy deployment

### 🧹 [Retail Sales Data Cleaning and Transformation](https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-etl)
> *Tools: Pandas, SQL, Talend*

- Cleaned messy sales data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, and database)
- Implemented transformation logic using Talend ETL
- Loaded clean data into a central warehouse for BI analysis

### 📁 [CSV to BigQuery Pipeline Using Mage](https://github.com/yourusername/mage-csv-to-bigquery)
> *Tools: Mage, Google BigQuery, Looker Studio*

- Processed raw CSV files into structured datasets
- Automated transformation with **Mage workflows**
- Connected results to **Looker Studio** for interactive dashboards
